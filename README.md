# What's in the fridge!

### Have you ever wanted to eat something, so you go to your fridge and you have a bunch of ingredients but don't know what to make out of them?

### This is the app for you!

#### Using Reactjs, Expressjs, PostgresSQL, Bootstrap and Node SASS, this multi-page app uses the API Spoonacular to fetch recipes when the user inputs thier ingredients and returns a series of recipes for the user to choose from.
